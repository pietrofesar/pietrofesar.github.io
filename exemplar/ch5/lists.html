            <dd>Line-casting allowed type to be selected, used, then recirculated
            into the machine automatically. This advance increased the speed of
            typesetting and printing dramatically.</dd>
            
            <dt>Photocomposition</dt>
            <dd>Typefaces are stored on film then projected onto photo-sensitive
            paper. Lenses adjust the size of the type.</dd>
            
            <dt>Digital type</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Digital typefaces store the outline of the font shape in a
                format such as Postscript. The outline may be scaled to any size for
                output.</p>
                <p>Postscript emerged as a standard due to its support of
                graphics and its early support on the Macintosh computer and Apple
                laser printer.</p>
